* mgcpp

A CUDA based C++ Multi GPU Linear Algebra Library

** Introduction
   mgcpp is a multi GPU linear algebra library.
   It is a wrapper for various CUDA libraries in standard C++.

** Libraries
   These dependencies are optional. 
   Not including them might result in some featrues not working properly.

   - cuBLAS for various BLAS operations.
   - cuSPARSE for sparse operations
   - MAGMA for hight level linear algebra operations.
   
** Dependencies
   - gtest (optional)
   - cuda (>8.0)
     
** TODO
   - [X] Finish thread context class for managing threads.
   - [ ] Support msvc build.
   - [ ] Add BLAS operations.
   - [ ] Add sparse matrix
   - [ ] Add sparse operations.
   - [ ] Add high level linear algebra operations.
   - [ ] Add benchmark
